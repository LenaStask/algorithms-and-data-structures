# Algorithms and Data Structures (JavaScript)

This repository contains my solutions for common algorithms and data structures implemented in JavaScript.  
The goal of this project is to strengthen problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## Topics Covered
- Sorting algorithms (Bubble, Merge, Quick)
- Searching algorithms (Binary, Linear)
- Data structures (Stack, Queue, Linked List, Hash Table)
- Recursion and complexity analysis

## Technologies
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## Notes
Each algorithm is implemented in a separate file with clear and readable code.
Time and space complexity are mentioned in comments where applicable.
